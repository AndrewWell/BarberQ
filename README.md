# BarberQ
The work of a barbershop is modeled in Java.
Two types of clients can come to a barbershop with one chair. Clients of the first type only want to get their hair cut. 
The distribution of their arrival intervals is 35 ± 10 min. Clients of the second type want to get a haircut and a shave. 
The distribution of their arrival intervals is 60 ± 20 min. The barber serves clients on a first-come, first-served basis. 
The working day of the hairdresser is 8 hours. The schedule of the hairdresser's work and the time of work, together with the range of execution, can be changed.
